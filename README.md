===============

Code for America Philly Parks Repo

See live demo at [http://nixta.github.io/PhillyParksDemo/](http://nixta.github.io/PhillyParksDemo/). Just click on the map to find the nearest 3 farmers markets that are also close to a park.

An ArcGIS Online login is required to perform the Closest Facility Task. Get a [free developer account](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/sign-up/) or a [30-day trial of the full system](http://www.arcgis.com/features/free-trial.html). Either will suffice for this demo.
